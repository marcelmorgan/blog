I started programming in high school way back in 1998. I knew right there and then, what
I wanted to do; I wanted to be a programmer. All of a sudden I could build programs that
could not only benefit me, but so many others. As a boy, I loved experimenting; I particular
liked physics and the practical side of experimenting. I however could not take this home as
all those tools were pretty expensive. Then came programming, with just one tool (the PC),
I could carry out unlimited experiments; free to build anything I wanted to for as much as I
wanted.
